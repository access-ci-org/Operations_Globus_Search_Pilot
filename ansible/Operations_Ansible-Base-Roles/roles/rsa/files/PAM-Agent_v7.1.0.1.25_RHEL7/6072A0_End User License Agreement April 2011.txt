2.	DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION.
A.	Delivery.  Title and risk of loss to the Hardware shall transfer to Customer upon RSA's delivery to a carrier at RSA's designated point of shipment ("Delivery"). Unless otherwise agreed, a common carrier shall be specified by RSA. Software may be provided by (i) Delivery of physical media; or (ii) electronic means (where available from RSA). If the Hardware has not been sold (for example - a lease or rental transaction), then risk of loss thereto transfers at Delivery, but title does not.
B.	Installation and Acceptance.  RSA's obligation, if any, to install Software as part of the Software's licensing fee, is set forth in the Product Notice. Acceptance that Software or Hardware operates in substantial conformity to the Documentation occurs upon Delivery or electronic availability, as applicable. Notwithstanding such acceptance, Customer retains all rights and remedies set forth in Section 4 (WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER) below.
3.	LICENSE TERMS.
A.	General License Grant.  Subject to Customer's compliance with this Agreement, the Product Notice, and payment of all license fees, RSA grants to Customer a nonexclusive and nontransferable (except as otherwise permitted herein) license (with no right to sublicense) to use (i) Software for Customer's internal business purposes; and (ii) the Documentation for the purpose of supporting Customer's use of Software or Hardware. Licenses granted to Customer shall, unless otherwise indicated on the Product Notice or quote from RSA or Distributor be perpetual and commence on Delivery of the physical media or the date Customer is notified of electronic availability, as applicable. Documentation is licensed solely for purposes of supporting Customer's use of Software or Hardware as permitted in this Section. To the extent applicable to Software, Customer may be required to follow RSA's then current product registration process, if any, to obtain and input an authorization key or license file.
B.	Licensing Models.  Software is licensed for use only in accordance with the commercial terms and restrictions of the Software's relevant licensing model, which are stated in the Product Notice and/or quote from RSA or Distributor. 
C.	License Restrictions.  All Software licenses granted herein are for use of object code only. Customer is permitted to copy Software as necessary to install and run it in accordance with the license, but otherwise for back-up purposes only. Customer may copy Documentation insofar as reasonably necessary in connection with Customer's authorized internal use of Software. Customer shall not, without RSA's prior written consent (i) use Software in a service bureau, application service provider or similar capacity; or (ii) disclose to any third party the results of any comparative or competitive analyses, benchmark testing or analyses of Software performed by or on behalf of Customer; (iii) make available Software in any form to anyone other than Customer's employees or contractors; (iv) transfer Software to an Affiliate or a third party; or (v) for any Software that is licensed with Hardware, Customer may only use such Software on the Hardware on which it was provided.
D.	No Combination with Open Source Software. Some third party license terms require that computer code be generally (a) disclosed in source code form to third parties, (b) licensed to third parties for the purpose of making derivative works, or (c) redistributable to third parties at no charge (collectively, "Excluded License Terms"). If RSA grants Customer the right to incorporate, modify, combine or distribute any of the Software licensed hereunder, then Customer shall not incorporate, modify, combine or distribute the Software with any other computer code in a manner that would subject the Software to Excluded License Terms.
E.	Audit Rights.  RSA (including its independent auditors) shall have the right to audit Customer's usage of Software to confirm compliance with the agreed terms. Such audit is subject to reasonable advance notice by RSA and shall not unreasonably interfere with Customer's business activities. Customer will provide RSA with the support required to perform such audit and will, without prejudice to other rights of RSA, address any non-compliant situations identified by the audit by forthwith procuring additional licenses.
F.	Termination.  RSA may terminate licenses for cause, if Customer breaches the terms governing use of Software or Hardware and fails to cure within thirty (30) days after receipt of RSA's written notice thereof. Upon termination of a license, Customer shall cease all use and return or certify destruction of the applicable Software (including copies) to RSA.
G.	Reserved Rights.  All rights not expressly granted to Customer are reserved. In particular, no title to, or ownership of, the Software is transferred to Customer. Customer shall reproduce and include copyright and other proprietary notices on and in any copies of the Software. Unless expressly permitted by applicable mandatory law, Customer shall not modify, enhance, supplement, create derivative works from, reverse assemble, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise reduce to human readable form the Software without RSA's prior written consent, nor shall Customer permit any third party to do the same.
4.	WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER.
A.	Warranty.  RSA warrants that Software will substantially conform to the applicable Documentation for such Software and that any Hardware provided by RSA will be free from manufacturing defects, malfunctions, errors or other defects in materials and workmanship until the expiration of the applicable warranty period.

All replaced Software contained on physical media supplied by RSA and Hardware shall be returned to and become the property of RSA. RSA shall have no liability hereunder after expiration of the applicable warranty period. The foregoing shall not void any supplementary remedies made available to Customer by a Distributor, with respect to which RSA shall have no liability or obligation.
D.	Warranty Exclusions.  Warranty does not cover problems that arise from (i) accident or neglect by Customer or any third party; (ii) any third party items or services with which Software or Hardware is used or other causes beyond RSA's control; (iii) installation, operation or use not in accordance with RSA's instructions or the applicable Documentation; (iv) use in an environment, in a manner or for a purpose for which Software or Hardware was not designed; or (v) modification, alteration or repair by anyone other than RSA or its authorized representatives;. RSA has no obligation whatsoever for Software or Hardware installed or used beyond the licensed use, or whose original identification marks have been altered or removed.
E.	No Further Warranties.  Except for the warranty set forth herein, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, RSA (INCLUDING ITS SUPPLIERS) MAKES NO OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, WRITTEN OR ORAL. INSOFAR AS PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES ARISING BY STATUTE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
